Sorted by Price: We first ranked products from most expensive to least expensive.

Sorted by Ratings: Within the same price, higher-rated products are ranked higher.

Highlight Premium Products: Businesses can feature top-priced and high-rated items in promotions.

Stock Inventory: Focus on stocking the top-ranked products.

Customer Attraction: Promote highly-rated products to attract more customers.

This helps businesses make smarter marketing and inventory decisions.
